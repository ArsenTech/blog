## Introduction
Did you accidentally tap a **"CLICK SUBSCRIBE"** pop-up on Safari or a suspicious website?
Is your iPhone suddenly filled with calendar spam, fake virus alerts, adult ads, or scam notifications?

This guide will help you completely remove the dangerous calendar spam virus from your iPhone and stop it from coming back.

> [!WARNING]
> This is NOT a real virus app, it's a malicious subscribed calendar sending spam notifications.
> Never click on the links inside the spam events. They are fake, dangerous, and can lead to real malware or scams.

## Solution 1 — Remove the Subscribed Calendar (Most Effective)
This method works on **all iPhones**, from iOS 12 to iOS 18.
### 1. Open the Calendar App
1. Tap Calendars at the bottom
2. Look for suspicious entries such as:
     - **CLICK SUBSCRIBE**
     - **Important Alerts**
     - **Virus Warning**
     - **Urgent Message**
     - **Security Check Required**
Uncheck the suspicious calendar to stop the notifications temporarily.

### 2. Remove the Malicious Subscription
1. Open **Settings**
2. Scroll down → tap **Passwords & Accounts** (iOS 15+ users: **Settings → Mail → Accounts**)
3. Tap **Subscribed Calendars**
4. Tap the suspicious entry ("CLICK SUBSCRIBE" or similar)
5. Tap **Delete Account**
6. Confirm by tapping **Delete Account**

Once deleted, all spam events disappear instantly.

## Solution 2 — Remove It Through iCloud (Alternative Method)
If Solution 1 does not show the malicious calendar:
1. Open **Settings**
2. Tap your name (Apple ID banner)
3. Tap **iCloud**
4. Toggle **Calendar** OFF then ON again

This forces your device to refresh your synced calendars.

## Solution 3 — Safari Reset (Stops New Spam Pop-ups)
Calendar spam usually comes from a malicious Safari website.
Reset Safari to block future fake "Subscribe" pop-ups.
1. Go to **Settings**
2. Scroll down → tap **Safari**
3. Tap **Clear History and Website Data**
4. Tap **Clear History and Data**
5. Scroll further down → tap **Advanced → Website Data**
6. Tap **Remove All Website Data**

This removes the malicious script that tricked you into subscribing.

## Solution 4 — Disable Notifications Temporarily
If the spam is nonstop and you need peace before fixing it:
1. Go to **Settings**
2. Tap **Notifications**
3. Tap **Calendar**
4. Turn off:
     - **Allow Notifications**
     - **Alerts**
     - **Sounds**

This doesn't remove the virus, but it stops the spam while you're fixing it :-)

## Do NOT Download Antivirus Apps from Ads
Calendar spam frequently tries to scare users into downloading fake antivirus apps such as:
- *“iPhone Cleaner Pro”*
- *“Virus Removal Tool”*
- *“Security Booster”*
- *“Update Required”*
- *“Phone Protection App”*

> [!WARNING]
> These apps are fake, unsafe, and often used to steal money or personal data.
> Never trust antivirus ads that appear in your calendar or Safari pop-ups.

## Preventing the Spam in the Future
- [X] **Avoid clicking suspicious pop-ups!**[^1]
- [X] **Keep iOS updated**[^2]
- [X] **Disable pop-ups**[^3]
- [X] **Enable Fraudulent Website Warnings**[^4]

[^1]: If a website asks you:
     > “This site wants to Add a Calendar Subscription”

     Always tap **Don't Allow** unless you trust the site.

[^2]: Go to `Settings → General → Software Update`

[^3]: Safari → Settings → **Block Pop-ups** (should be **ON**)

[^4]: Safari → **Fraudulent Website Warning** (should be **ON**)

These built-in protections stop most calendar scam attempts.

## Conclusion
And that's it! You've successfully removed the dangerous calendar spam from your iPhone.
This issue is extremely common, but fortunately very easy to fix once you remove the malicious subscribed calendar.

To avoid this in the future, never accept unknown calendar subscriptions and always keep Safari protections enabled.
