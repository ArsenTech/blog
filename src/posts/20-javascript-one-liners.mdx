## Introduction

**JavaScript one-liners** are small utility functions that solve common problems with minimal code. They're not about being clever — they're about readability, reuse, and understanding **core JavaScript concepts**. This guide will show you **20 useful one-liner functions** you need to know and use on **any JavaScript project**.
All examples use **modern JavaScript (ES6+)** and work in both browser and Node.js environments.

If you prefer watching instead of reading, the same examples are explained step by step in the video below: [Watch the video on YouTube](https://youtu.be/c-HgptUzl8o)

## Number-Based One-Liners
### Get a Random Number Between Two Values
```js
const getRandomNumber = (min, max) => Math.floor(Math.random()*(max-min))+min;

console.log(getRandomNumber(1,10))
```
This function returns a random integer between `min` (inclusive) and `max` (exclusive).
It's useful for things like IDs, simple games, or random selections.
> [!TIP]
> The `(max - min)` part ensures the number stays within the expected range.

### Calculate the Factorial of a Number
```js
const factorial = number => number <= 1 ? 1 : number * factorial(number - 1);

console.log(factorial(7))
```
This is a recursive one-liner that calculates the factorial of a number.
Factorials are commonly used in mathematics, algorithms, and probability calculations.

### Check If a Number Is Positive
```js
const isPositive = num => num > 0;

console.log(isPositive(5))
console.log(isPositive(-5))
```
Returns `true` if the number is greater than zero, otherwise `false`.

### Check If a Number Is Even
```js
const isEven = num => num % 2 === 0;

console.log(isEven(1));
console.log(isEven(2));
```
A quick utility often used in validations and conditions.

### Check If a Number Is Odd
```js
const isOdd = num => num % 2 !== 0;

console.log(isOdd(2));
console.log(isOdd(3))
```
Returns `true` for odd numbers and `false` otherwise.

### Calculate the Area of a Circle
```js
const getCircleArea = rad => Math.PI*rad**2;

console.log(getCircleArea(8))
```
Uses the mathematical formula **π × r²**.

### Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit
```js
const toFahrenheit = celsius => (celsius*9/5)+32;
console.log(toFahrenheit(30))
```
Useful for unit conversions in everyday applications.

## Array-Based One-Liners
### Generate a Random Item From an Array
```js
const getRandomValue = arr => arr[Math.floor(Math.random()*arr.length)];

console.log(getRandomValue(["a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h"]))
```
This function selects a random element from an array.
It works with any array type: strings, numbers, objects, or mixed values.

### Shuffle an Array
```js
const shuffle = arr => arr.sort(()=>0.5-Math.random());

console.log(shuffle([0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]))
```
This is a simple way to shuffle an array in place.
> [!NOTE]
> This method is fine for small or casual use cases.
For statistically perfect shuffling, a [Fisher-Yates shuffle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle) is recommended.

### Get Even Numbers From an Array
```js
const getEvenNumbers = arr => arr.filter(num=>num%2===0);

console.log(getEvenNumbers([0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]))
```
Filters out all even numbers from an array using `Array.filter().`

### Get Odd Numbers From an Array
```js
const getOddNumbers = arr => arr.filter(num=>num%2!==0);

console.log(getOddNumbers([0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]))
```
The opposite of even filtering — useful for number processing tasks.

### Find the Average of an Array
```js
const getAverage = arr => (arr.reduce((acc,num)=>acc+num,0))/arr.length;

console.log(getAverage([0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]))
```
Adds all values and divides by the array length to get the average.

### Sum All Numbers in an Array
```js
const sum = arr => arr.reduce((acc,num)=>acc+num,0);

console.log(sum([0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]))
```
A compact way to calculate totals.

### Remove Duplicates From an Array
```js
const getUniqueItems = arr => [...new Set(arr)];

console.log(getUniqueItems([0,1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6,7,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,1,2,3,3,3,3,3]))
```
Uses `Set` to keep only unique values.

### Check If an Array Is Empty
```js
const isEmpty = arr => arr.length === 0;

console.log(isEmpty([]))
console.log(isEmpty([1,2,3]))
```
A simple and reliable way to check if an array contains no elements.

## String-Based One-Liners
### Count the Vowels in a String
```js
const countVowels = str => (str.match(/[aeiou]/gi) || []).length;

console.log(countVowels("ArsenTech"))
```
Uses a regular expression to count vowels, ignoring case.

### Reverse a String
```js
const reverseString = str => str.split("").reverse().join("");

console.log(reverseString("Hello World"))
```
Splits the string into characters, reverses them, and joins them back.

### Convert a String to an Array of Words
```js
const toWordsArray = str => str.split(" ");

console.log(toWordsArray("Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit amet"))
```
Splits a sentence into words using spaces as separators.

### Capitalize a String
```js
const capitalize = str => str[0].toUpperCase() + str.slice(1);

console.log(capitalize("arsenTech"))
```
Capitalizes the first character of a string.

### Check If a String Is a Palindrome
```js
const isPalindrome = str => str === str.split("").reverse().join("");

console.log(isPalindrome("kayak"))
console.log(isPalindrome("coding"))
```
A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards. This example is case-sensitive and space-sensitive.

## Things to Keep in Mind
- **One-liners aren't always better**
     If a function becomes harder to read, clarity should win over brevity.
- **Some methods mutate data**
     Functions like `Array.sort()` modify the original array. Clone when needed.
- **Simple ≠ perfect**
     Some shortcuts (like array shuffling) are fine for everyday use but not for cryptographic or statistical accuracy.
- **Understand before copying**
     These examples are most useful when you understand why they work, not just that they work.

## Conclusion
JavaScript one-liners are small tools that solve common problems efficiently and clearly. When used thoughtfully, they can reduce boilerplate and make your code easier to read and maintain.

You don't need to memorize all of them — just recognize patterns and reuse what fits your project.
