## Introduction
Got infected by **000.exe** and can't figure out how to remove it?
This guide will help you get rid of that malware on any Windows computer — **without antivirus software or outside help**.

000.exe is not as destructive as deep ransomware or MBR malware.
It mainly:
- Spams **runaway message boxes**
- Creates junk files
- Edits small registry values
- Changes your wallpaper
- Drops startup entries

Your **data and bootloader are safe**, only cosmetic and annoying changes are made.

> [!WARNING]
> Do not download malware or execute unknown scripts on a real machine.
> All demonstrations on ArsenTech are performed inside isolated virtual machines.
> Readers should follow the tutorial carefully and fully understand the steps before removing malware.

## Step 1 - Stopping the Message Boxes
000.exe spams message boxes every millisecond, making your PC unusable.

### 1. Stop CMD-based popups
Open Command Prompt as Administrator and type:
```cmd
taskkill /f /im cmd.exe
```
This stops the chained message box commands.

### 2. Stop the main spammer executable
Open Command Prompt as Administrator again:
```cmd
taskkill /f /im runaway.exe
```
This immediately kills the process responsible for generating thousands of popups.

> [!NOTE]
> `runaway.exe` is an executable dropped by 000.exe to repeatedly launch spam message boxes.

Once finished, your desktop should be clean and usable.

## Step 2 - Delete Files Planted by 000.exe
000.exe creates `.txt` and `.rtf` files on the desktop named `UR NEXT`

To delete all of them at once, press:
<KbdGroup>
     <Kbd>Ctrl</Kbd>
     <span>+</span>
     <Kbd>A</Kbd>
</KbdGroup>
to select all files on your desktop. Then permanently delete them:
<KbdGroup>
     <Kbd>Shift</Kbd>
     <span>+</span>
     <Kbd>Del</Kbd>
</KbdGroup>

Empty your Recycle Bin afterward. This removes all visible leftovers from the malware.

## Step 3 - Restore Your Theme & Desktop Background
000.exe replaces your wallpaper with a corrupted image.

To restore your desktop appearance:
- Open **Settings**
- Go to **Personalization → Themes**
- Select your original theme
- Reapply your preferred wallpaper

Your system should now visually appear normal again.

## Step 4 - Registry changes
> [!CAUTION]
> Only modify the registry keys shown below. Editing unrelated values may corrupt Windows and cause boot failure.

Open the run dialog:
<KbdGroup>
     <Kbd>⊞</Kbd>
     <span>+</span>
     <Kbd>R</Kbd>
</KbdGroup>
And type `regedit`. If prompted, click **Yes**.

### Registry Change 1 - Enable Task Manager
Navigate to:
```
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System
```

Right-click and **delete** `DisableTaskMgr`

Task Manager will work again after restarting your PC.

### Registry Change 2 - Change the Icon of the Text files
000.exe points .txt icons to a malicious file. Reset it to the Windows default by navigating to:
```
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT/txtfile/DefaultIcon
```
And changing the **(Default)** entry:
| Before                                            | After                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\temp\icon.ico` | `C:\Windows\system32\imageres.dll,-102` |

This restores the normal text document icon.
Changes take effect after a restart.

## Step 5 - Remove Startup Entries
Open File Explorer and go to:
```
%programdata%/Microsoft/Windows/Start Menu/Programs/Startup
```
Delete `rniw.exe`

> [!NOTE]
> `rniw.exe` rniw.exe is a startup program created by 000.exe to re-enable its message boxes.

## Step 5 - Clear Temporary Files
Open the Run dialog:
<KbdGroup>
     <Kbd>⊞</Kbd>
     <span>+</span>
     <Kbd>R</Kbd>
</KbdGroup>

Type `%temp%`.

Select all files and delete everything inside the Temp folder.
This removes leftover icons, scripts, and junk files dropped by 000.exe.

## Step 7 - Restore Your Username
000.exe may rename your Windows account to **UR NEXT**.

To restore it:
1. Press the following keys:
   <KbdGroup>
        <Kbd>⊞</Kbd>
        <span>+</span>
        <Kbd>R</Kbd>
   </KbdGroup>
2. Type `control`
3. Navigate to: `User Accounts → User Accounts`
4. Click **Change your account name**

Choose your preferred name and restart your PC.

## Conclusion
And that’s it!
The 000.exe virus has been completely removed from your system.

This malware mainly changes:
- Registry values
- Wallpaper & theme
- Text icons
- Startup programs
- User account name
- Temporary files
- Message box spammers

So restoring everything **manually** is essential.

**To prevent future infections:**
- Delete suspicious `.exe` files immediately
- Never run unknown programs
- Use a stronger antivirus
- Keep real-time protection enabled
- Only test malware inside virtual machines
- Avoid downloading from untrusted websites
- Practice safe browsing habits
