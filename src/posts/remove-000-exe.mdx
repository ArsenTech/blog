## Introduction
Got infected by **000.exe** and can't figure out how to remove it?
This guide will help you get rid of that malware on any Windows computer — **without antivirus software or outside help**.

000.exe is not as destructive as deep ransomware or MBR malware.
It mainly:
- Spams **runaway message boxes**
- Creates junk files
- Edits small registry values
- Changes your wallpaper
- Drops startup entries

Your **data and bootloader are safe**, only cosmetic and annoying changes are made.

> [!WARNING]
> Do not download malware or execute unknown scripts on a real machine.
> All demonstrations on ArsenTech are performed inside isolated virtual machines.
> Readers should follow the tutorial carefully and fully understand the steps before removing malware.

## Step 1 - Stopping the Message Boxes
000.exe spams message boxes every millisecond, making your PC unusable.

### 1. Stop CMD-based popups
Open Command Prompt as Administrator and type:
```cmd
taskkill /f /im cmd.exe
```
This stops the chained message box commands.

### 2. Stop the main spammer executable
Open Command Prompt as Administrator again:
```cmd
taskkill /f /im runaway.exe
```
This immediately kills the process responsible for generating thousands of popups.

> [!NOTE]
> `runaway.exe` is an executable dropped by 000.exe to repeatedly launch spam message boxes.

Once finished, your desktop should be clean and usable.

## Step 2 - Delete Files Planted by 000.exe
000.exe creates `.txt` and `.rtf` files on the desktop named `UR NEXT`

To delete all of them at once, press:
<KbdGroup>
     <Kbd>Ctrl</Kbd>
     <span>+</span>
     <Kbd>A</Kbd>
</KbdGroup>
to select all files on your desktop. Then permanently delete them:
<KbdGroup>
     <Kbd>Shift</Kbd>
     <span>+</span>
     <Kbd>Del</Kbd>
</KbdGroup>

Empty your Recycle Bin afterward. This removes all visible leftovers from the malware.

## Step 3 - Restore Your Theme & Desktop Background
000.exe replaces your wallpaper and UI theme to make your system look corrupted or hacked.
To restore your theme:
1. Open **Settings**
2. Go to **Personalization → Themes**
3. Choose your preferred theme
4. Reapply your desktop background

Your system should now visually return to normal.

## Step 4 - Registry changes
> [!CAUTION]
> Only modify the registry keys shown below. Editing unrelated values may corrupt Windows and cause boot failure.

Open the run command by pressing the following keys:
<KbdGroup>
     <Kbd>⊞</Kbd>
     <span>+</span>
     <Kbd>R</Kbd>
</KbdGroup>
And type `regedit`. If prompted, click **Yes**.

### Registry Change 1 - Enable Task Manager
Navigate to:
```
HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Policies/System
```
And delete `DisableTaskMgr`

### Registry Change 2 - Change the Icon of the Text files
Navigate to:
```
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT/txtfile/DefaultIcon
```
Change the **(Default)** entry:
| Before                                            | After                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\temp\icon.ico` | `C:\Windows\system32\imageres.dll,-102` |

This will change the text icon back to the original place. It'll take effect after restart.

## Step 4 - Removing Startup Apps
Open the file explorer and navigate to:
```
%programdata%/Microsoft/Windows/Start Menu/Programs/Startup
```
and delete `rniw.exe`

> [!NOTE]
> `rniw.exe` is an executable planted by 000.exe to spam message boxes every millisecond.

## Step 5 - Removing Temporary files
Open the Run dialog:
<KbdGroup>
     <Kbd>⊞</Kbd>
     <span>+</span>
     <Kbd>R</Kbd>
</KbdGroup>

Type `%temp%`, and clear every single temporary file in this folder.

## Step 6 - Changing the username back.
Open the Run dialog:
<KbdGroup>
     <Kbd>⊞</Kbd>
     <span>+</span>
     <Kbd>R</Kbd>
</KbdGroup>

Type `control`. Go to:
```
User Accounts → User Accounts
```
Change your account name back to the preferred name.

Now Restart your PC.

## Conclusion
And that's it! 000.exe has been completely removed from your system.
This malware modifies registry entries, themes, user accounts, wallpapers, and core Windows settings, so restoring everything manually is critical.

To prevent future infections:
- Delete suspicious `.exe` files immediately
- Never run unknown programs
- Use a stronger antivirus
- Keep real-time protection enabled
- Always use a virtual machine for malware testing
- Follow safe browsing habits & avoid unknown downloads
