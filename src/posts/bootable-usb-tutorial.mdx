## Introduction

Creating a bootable USB is one of the easiest ways to install or repair an operating system (Like Windows or Linux).  
In this guide, you'll learn how to create a bootable USB using **Rufus** and other tools,  
and how to restore it back to normal afterwards so you can use it as regular storage.

### Requirements
- A USB flash drive (recommend 8GB or larger)
- Rufus (or another tool)
- ISO file for Windows/Linux
- A PC running Windows

## Step 1 - Download Rufus
Go to the [Rufus' official page](https://rufus.ie/en/), scroll down to the downloads page, and download the latest version of Rufus.

### Portable VS Installer

#### Installation Requirements
|Feature|Rufus|Rufus Portable|

|User Privileges|May require admin rights for some features|Typically requires only standard user privileges|

#### Ideal Use Cases
|Use Case|Rufus|Rufus Portable|
|-|-|-|
|Primary Device Usage|Best for dedicated workstations|Ideal for IT professionals or users on the go|
|Clean Operation|Leaves minimal traces on the system|Leaves no traces, ensuring a clean experience|

## Step 2 – USB and ISO setup
Now insert the correct USB drive into your PC (recommended minimum size: 8GB), so Rufus will detect it automatically, and choose the correct device for Bootable USB.

> [!WARNING]
> If you choose a USB to make it bootable, Rufus will format these drives. **Formatting may cause data loss**, so make sure you backup everything in the USB to the safe folder in either `C:` drive or `D:` drive

Now add the Windows or Linux ISO file under the Boot selection option, then configure the following settings:
- Partition Scheme (**MBR** or **GPT**)
- Target System (**BIOS** or **UEFI**),
- Bootable USB's volume label (e.g. `MX Linux Installer` or `WinPE Recovery`),
- File System (**FAT32** or **NTFS**)

## Step 3 - Create the Bootable USB
Click the `START` button and wait for a few minutes (depending on ISO size and USB file transfer speed).

Once the Progress bar says **"READY"**, eject the USB from the PC. Now you've successfully created a Bootable USB!

## Restoring the USB to Normal
After using your USB as a bootable drive, you may notice that its storage capacity appears smaller than before. For example, an 8 GB USB might suddenly show only 2 GB.

This happens because bootable tools (like Rufus, Ventoy, or manual ISO writers) often **repartition** the USB to fit system files or add special boot sectors.

The good news is it isn't damaged — You just need to **remove the bootable partitions and reformat the drive** to use its full storage again.

Below are three simple methods you can use to restore your USB back to normal size (reusable USB drive):
### Method 1: Using Diskpart (Command Prompt)
Open the run command by pressing the following keys:
<KbdGroup>
     <Kbd>⊞</Kbd>
     <span>+</span>
     <Kbd>R</Kbd>
</KbdGroup>
And type `cmd`.

Type `diskpart` and hit Enter <Kbd>⏎</Kbd>, and then click on `Yes` if the UAC prompt appeared.

Now run the following commands in DiskPart:
```cmd
list disk
select disk 1   :: Replace "1" with the number of your USB drive
clean
create partition primary
format fs=fat32 label=USB quick
exit
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure you **select the correct disk** before running clean, as it will permanently erase all data on that drive.

### Method 2: Using File Explorer (Quick Format)
Right-click the USB drive and select **Format**. Then do the following:
- Choose the File System (NTFS or FAT32, but FAT32 is recommended)
- Type the label (e.g.: `USB Drive`)
- Check the "Quick Format Option"

Click `Start` to format the bootable USB.

### Method 3: Using Rufus
Insert the bootable USB, set the **Boot selection** to `Non bootable`, then configure:
- Choose the File System (NTFS or FAT32, but FAT32 is recommended)
- Type the label (e.g.: `USB Drive`)

Then click the `START` button.

Once the Progress bar says **"READY"**, eject the USB from the PC. Now you've successfully converted the Bootable USB back to normal!

> [!TIP]
> Always safely eject your USB drive after formatting to prevent file system errors.

## Alternatives to Rufus
Each of these tools has its pros and cons:
- **Balena Etcher** — simple and cross-platform.
- **Ventoy** — supports multiple ISOs on a single USB.
- **dd (Linux command)** — fast but requires care to avoid overwriting drives.

## Conclusion
Creating a bootable USB is one of the simplest ways to install or repair your operating system — and restoring it afterwards ensures your USB stays usable for years. Always double-check your disk before formatting!
