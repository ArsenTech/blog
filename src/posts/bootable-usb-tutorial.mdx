## Introduction

Creating a bootable USB is one of the easiest ways to install or repair an operating system (Like Windows or Linux).  
In this guide, you'll learn how to create a bootable USB using **Rufus** and other tools,  
and how to restore it back to normal afterwards so you can use it as regular storage.

### Requirements
- A USB flash drive (recommend 8GB or larger)
- Rufus (or another tool)
- ISO file for Windows/Linux
- A PC running Windows

## Step 1 - Download Rufus
Go to the [Rufus' official page](https://rufus.ie/en/), scroll down to the downloads page, and download the latest version of Rufus.

## Step 2 – USB and ISO setup
Now Insert the correct USB drive to PC (recommended minimum size: 8GB), so Rufus will detect it automatically, and choose the correct device for Bootable USB.

> [!WARNING]
> If you choose a USB to make it bootable, Rufus will format these drives. Formatting may cause data loss, so make sure you backup everything in the USB to the safe folder in either `C:` drive or `D:` drive

Now Add the Windows / Linux ISO file into the Boot selection option, then do configurations on the following options
- Partition Scheme (**MBR** or **GPT**)
- Target System (**BIOS** or **UEFI**),
- Bootable USB's volume label (e.g. `MX Linux Installer` or `WinPE Recovery`),
- File System (**FAT32** or **NTFS**)

## Step 3 - Create the Bootable USB
Click the `START` button and wait for few minutes (depending on ISO size and USB file transfer speed).

Once the Progress bar says **"READY"**, eject the USB from the PC. Now you've successfully created a Bootable USB!

## Restoring the USB to Normal
- Why USB sometimes shows smaller size after making bootable
- How to format USB in File Explorer
- If formatting doesn't work → use **Diskpart** (step-by-step commands)
- USB returns to full normal storage use

## Alternatives to Rufus
- Balena Etcher (cross-platform)
- Ventoy (multi-boot ISO USB)
- Linux `dd` command
