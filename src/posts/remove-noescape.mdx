## Step 1 - Recovery Using Windows PE

Before removing NoEscape.exe, you must boot into a **safe offline environment**, such as **Windows PE (Windows Preinstallation Environment)**. This ensures that the malware cannot run while you are repairing the system.

### What You Need
- A clean computer
- A USB flash drive
- A Windows PE ISO (from trusted sources)
- A bootable USB tool (Rufus, Ventoy, etc.)

### Steps
1. Create a Windows PE bootable USB (see the Bootable USB blog post if you need help).
2. Insert the USB into the infected PC.
3. Boot the PC and enter the Boot Menu (usually F2, F8, F11, F12, or Esc depending on manufacturer).
4. Select the USB and boot into Windows PE.

Once inside Windows PE, open Command Prompt and type `regedit`. This will allow you to manually repair the damaged registry entries injected by NoEscape.exe.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Windows PE is required because NoEscape.exe modifies registry entries while Windows is running.
> Editing them while the system is offline prevents the malware from interfering or reapplying its changes.

## Step 2 - Registry Repair (Critical Step)
> [!CAUTION]
> Only modify the registry keys shown below. Editing unrelated values may corrupt Windows and cause boot failure.

Inside the Registry Editor:
1. Select HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
2. Click File → Load Hive

You will now load the registry hives from the infected Windows installation:

### Hives To Load

| Hive Name (You Choose) | Physical File Path                    | Represents                     |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **InfectedPCSoftware** | `C:\Windows\System32\config\SOFTWARE` | `HKLM\SOFTWARE` of infected PC |
| **InfectedPCSystem**   | `C:\Windows\System32\config\SYSTEM`   | `HKLM\SYSTEM` of infected PC   |
| **InfectedPCUser**     | `C:\Users\<username>\NTUSER.DAT`      | `HKCU` of infected PC's user   |

This loads the infected system's registry into Windows PE.

### Registry Change 1 - Fix EXE File Hijack
Navigate to:
```
InfectedPCSoftware/Classes/exefile/shell/open/command
```
Change the **(Default)** entry:
| Before                           | After     |
| -------------------------------- | --------- |
| `C:\Windows\winnt32.exe "%1" %*` | `"%1" %*` |

Repeat the same fix here:
```
InfectedPCSoftware/Classes/exefile/shell/runas/command
```
> [!NOTE]
> `C:\Windows\winnt32.exe` is a malicious executable planted by NoEscape.exe to hijack every `.exe` you open.

### Registry Change 2 - Repair Winlogon Hijack
Navigate to:
```
InfectedPCSoftware/Microsoft/Windows NT/CurrentVersion/Winlogon
```
Update or Delete Values:
| Name               | Before                                                    | After                              |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `Userinit`         | `C:\Windows\system32\userinit.exe,C:\Windows\winnt32.exe` | `C:\Windows\system32\userinit.exe` |
| `DisableCAD`       | `1`                                                       | *(Delete)*                         |
| `AutoRestartShell` | `1`                                                       | *(Delete)*                         |
| `AutoAdminLogon`   | `1`                                                       | *(Delete)*                         |

These entries are used by NoEscape.exe to retain control after login.

### Registry Change 3 - Restore System Policies
Navigate to:
```
InfectedPCSoftware/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Policies/System
```
Perform the following actions:
1. Set `EnableLUA` to `1`
2. Delete `shutdownwithoutlogon`

### Registry Change 4 - Restore Windows Logon UI
Navigate to:
```
InfectedPCSoftware/Policies/Microsoft/Windows/System
```
And delete `DisableLogonBackgroundImage`

### Registry Change 5 - Reset Keyboard Layout (Removes Key Remapping)
Navigate to:
```
InfectedPCSystem/CurrentControlSet/Control/Keyboard Layout/
```
If **CurrentControlSet** doesn't exist, use this instead:
```
InfectedPCSystem/ControlSet001/Control/Keyboard Layout
```
And delete `Scancode Map`. This restores correct keyboard input.

### Registry Change 6 - Fix User Profile Modifications
Navigate to:
```
InfectedPCUser/Control Panel
```
Remove these modifications:
| Name                       | Before | After      |
| -------------------------- | ------ | ---------- |
| `Mouse/SwapMouseButtons`   | `1`    | *(Delete)* |
| `Desktop/AutoColorization` | `1`    | *(Delete)* |

### Registry Change 7 - Re-enable Registry Editing (UAC Policies)
Navigate to:
```
HKCU/Software/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Policies/System
```
And Delete `DisableRegistryTools`. This re-enables Regedit on the repaired system.

### Registry Change 8 - Re-enable Command Prompt
Navigate to:
```
HKCU/Software/Policies/Microsoft/Windows/System
```
And delete `DisableCMD`. This restores access to CMD on the infected user account.

### Final Step - Unload Hives Properly

Before shutting down Windows PE:
1. Select each loaded hive (InfectedPCSoftware, InfectedPCSystem, InfectedPCUser)
2. Go to `File → Unload Hive`
3. Confirm

This ensures the registry is saved correctly.

Now restart the computer normally.
If the registry was repaired correctly, Windows should boot without NoEscape.exe reactivating.

## Step 3 - Deleting Files planted by NoEscape.exe

After reboot and log in, open the File Explorer, navigate to:
```
C:\Windows
```
By default, `winnt32.exe` is hidden, make sure to open Folder options → View and temporarily uncheck the following:
- Hide protected operating system files
- Hide empty drives

And set `Hidden files and folders` to `Show hidden files, folders, and drives`.

Once it's visible, delete `winnt32.exe` completely.

Now mention every single file on desktop planted by NoEscape.exe using
<KbdGroup>
     <Kbd>Ctrl</Kbd>
     <span>+</span>
     <Kbd>A</Kbd>
</KbdGroup>

and delete these files using
<KbdGroup>
     <Kbd>Shift</Kbd>
     <span>+</span>
     <Kbd>Del</Kbd>
</KbdGroup>
Don't forget to empty the recycle bin.

Then
- Check `Hide protected operating system files`
- Check `Hide empty drives`
- Set `Hidden files and folders` to `Don't show hidden files, folders, and drives`.

## Step 4
Navigate to `Settings → Personalization → Themes` and set the theme to your preferred theme. Set the desktop background to the preferred one.

## Step 5 - Deleting MORE files planted by NoEscape.exe
Open the run command:
<KbdGroup>
     <Kbd>⊞</Kbd>
     <span>+</span>
     <Kbd>R</Kbd>
</KbdGroup>
and type `%localappdata%`.

Delete `noescape.png`.

Navigate to
```
%programdata%/Microsoft/User Account Pictures
```
and delete the modified profile pictures (or replace them with the original one if you have it)

## Step 6 - Removing users created by NoEscape.exe
Navigate to `Settings → Accounts → Other Users`, and remove every single user data created by NoEscape.exe (except the ones you've created)

Now open the run command:
<KbdGroup>
     <Kbd>⊞</Kbd>
     <span>+</span>
     <Kbd>R</Kbd>
</KbdGroup>
and type `control`.

Navigate to `User Accounts → User Accounts` and change the account name to the preferred name.
