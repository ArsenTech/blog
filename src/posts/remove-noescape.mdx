## Step 1 - Recovery Using Windows PE

Before removing NoEscape.exe, you must boot into a **safe offline environment**, such as **Windows PE (Windows Preinstallation Environment)**. This ensures that the malware cannot run while you are repairing the system.

### What You Need
- A clean computer
- A USB flash drive
- A Windows PE ISO (from trusted sources)
- A bootable USB tool (Rufus, Ventoy, etc.)

### Steps
1. Create a Windows PE bootable USB (see the Bootable USB blog post if you need help).
2. Insert the USB into the infected PC.
3. Boot the PC and enter the Boot Menu (usually F2, F8, F11, F12, or Esc depending on manufacturer).
4. Select the USB and boot into Windows PE.

Once inside Windows PE, open Command Prompt and type `regedit`. This will allow you to manually repair the damaged registry entries injected by NoEscape.exe.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Windows PE is required because NoEscape.exe modifies registry entries while Windows is running.
> Editing them while the system is offline prevents the malware from interfering or reapplying its changes.

## Step 2 - Registry Repair (Critical Step)
> [!CAUTION]
> Only modify the registry keys shown below. Editing unrelated values may corrupt Windows and cause boot failure.

Inside the Registry Editor:
1. Select HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
2. Click File → Load Hive

You will now load the registry hives from the infected Windows installation:

### Hives To Load

| Hive Name (You Choose) | Physical File Path                    | Represents                     |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **InfectedPCSoftware** | `C:\Windows\System32\config\SOFTWARE` | `HKLM\SOFTWARE` of infected PC |
| **InfectedPCSystem**   | `C:\Windows\System32\config\SYSTEM`   | `HKLM\SYSTEM` of infected PC   |
| **InfectedPCUser**     | `C:\Users\<username>\NTUSER.DAT`      | `HKCU` of infected PC's user   |

This loads the infected system's registry into Windows PE.

### Registry Change 1 - Fix EXE File Hijack
Navigate to:
```
InfectedPCSoftware/Classes/exefile/shell/open/command
```
Change the **(Default)** entry:
| Before                           | After     |
| -------------------------------- | --------- |
| `C:\Windows\winnt32.exe "%1" %*` | `"%1" %*` |

Repeat the same fix here:
```
InfectedPCSoftware/Classes/exefile/shell/runas/command
```
> [!NOTE]
> `C:\Windows\winnt32.exe` is a malicious executable planted by NoEscape.exe to hijack every `.exe` you open.

### Registry Change 2 - Repair Winlogon Hijack
Navigate to:
```
InfectedPCSoftware/Microsoft/Windows NT/CurrentVersion/Winlogon
```
Update or Delete Values:
| Name               | Before                                                    | After                              |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `Userinit`         | `C:\Windows\system32\userinit.exe,C:\Windows\winnt32.exe` | `C:\Windows\system32\userinit.exe` |
| `DisableCAD`       | `1`                                                       | *(Delete)*                         |
| `AutoRestartShell` | `1`                                                       | *(Delete)*                         |
| `AutoAdminLogon`   | `1`                                                       | *(Delete)*                         |

These entries are used by NoEscape.exe to retain control after login.

### Registry Change 3 - Restore System Policies
Navigate to:
```
InfectedPCSoftware/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Policies/System
```
Perform the following actions:
1. Set `EnableLUA` to `1`
2. Delete `shutdownwithoutlogon`

### Registry Change 4 - Restore Windows Logon UI
Navigate to:
```
InfectedPCSoftware/Policies/Microsoft/Windows/System
```
And delete `DisableLogonBackgroundImage`

### Registry Change 5 - Reset Keyboard Layout (Removes Key Remapping)
Navigate to:
```
InfectedPCSystem/CurrentControlSet/Control/Keyboard Layout/
```
If **CurrentControlSet** doesn't exist, use this instead:
```
InfectedPCSystem/ControlSet001/Control/Keyboard Layout
```
And delete `Scancode Map`. This restores correct keyboard input.

### Registry Change 6 - Fix User Profile Modifications
Navigate to:
```
InfectedPCUser/Control Panel
```
Remove these modifications:
| Name                       | Before | After      |
| -------------------------- | ------ | ---------- |
| `Mouse/SwapMouseButtons`   | `1`    | *(Delete)* |
| `Desktop/AutoColorization` | `1`    | *(Delete)* |

### Registry Change 7 - Re-enable Registry Editing (UAC Policies)
Navigate to:
```
HKCU/Software/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Policies/System
```
And Delete `DisableRegistryTools`. This re-enables Regedit on the repaired system.

### Registry Change 8 - Re-enable Command Prompt
Navigate to:
```
HKCU/Software/Policies/Microsoft/Windows/System
```
And delete `DisableCMD`. This restores access to CMD on the infected user account.

### Final Step - Unload Hives Properly

Before shutting down Windows PE:
1. Select each loaded hive (InfectedPCSoftware, InfectedPCSystem, InfectedPCUser)
2. Go to `File → Unload Hive`
3. Confirm

This ensures the registry is saved correctly.

Now restart the computer normally.
If the registry was repaired correctly, Windows should boot without NoEscape.exe reactivating.

## Step 3 - Deleting Files planted by NoEscape.exe

After restarting the repaired system and logging into Windows, the next step is to remove the malicious files that NoEscape.exe created.

### 1. Show Hidden & Protected System Files

Open File Explorer and go to:
```
C:\Windows
```

By default, winnt32.exe is hidden. To reveal it:
1. Open Folder Options → **View**
2. Temporarily disable:
- **Hide protected operating system files (Recommended)**
- **Hide empty drives**
3. Under Hidden files and folders, select:
- **Show hidden files, folders, and drives**

Click **Apply**.

### 2. Delete `winnt32.exe`

Now that hidden system files are visible, locate and delete `winnt32.exe`

This file is responsible for the EXE hijack.

> [!CAUTION]
> Make sure you **ONLY** delete the file located directly inside C:\Windows.
> Do **NOT** delete any legitimate system files.

### 3. Remove Malicious Desktop Files

NoEscape.exe creates random files on the desktop to clutter the desktop with these files.

To delete all of them at once, press:
<KbdGroup>
     <Kbd>Ctrl</Kbd>
     <span>+</span>
     <Kbd>A</Kbd>
</KbdGroup>
to select all desktop items. Then permanently delete them with:
<KbdGroup>
     <Kbd>Shift</Kbd>
     <span>+</span>
     <Kbd>Del</Kbd>
</KbdGroup>

Empty your Recycle Bin afterward.

### 4. Restore File Explorer Settings

When done, revert the folder settings:
- Enable **“Hide protected operating system files”**
- Enable **“Hide empty drives”**
- Set “Hidden files and folders” to **Don’t show hidden files, folders, or drives**

This protects your system from accidental file deletion later.

## Step 4 - Restore Your Theme & Desktop Background
NoEscape.exe replaces your wallpaper and UI theme to make your system look corrupted or hacked.

To restore your theme:
1. Open **Settings**
2. Go to **Personalization → Themes**
3. Choose your preferred theme
4. Reapply your desktop background

Your system should now visually return to normal.

## Step 5 - Deleting More files planted by NoEscape.exe

### 1. Remove LocalAppData Image
Open the Run dialog:
<KbdGroup>
     <Kbd>⊞</Kbd>
     <span>+</span>
     <Kbd>R</Kbd>
</KbdGroup>

Type `%localappdata%`. Find and delete `noescape.png`

This is the custom wallpaper the malware forces onto the system.

2. Remove Modified User Account Pictures

Navigate to:
```
%programdata%\Microsoft\User Account Pictures
```
Delete the modified profile icons created by NoEscape.exe.

If you have your original user icon backed up, replace it here.

## Step 6 - Removing Fake Users Created by NoEscape.exe
NoEscape.exe creates extra fake users to weaken system security and confuse the victim.
1. Open **Settings**
2. Go to **Accounts → Other Users**
3. Manually delete any suspicious accounts (DO NOT delete your real account).

## Step 7 - Restore Your Account

### Restore your account name
Open the Run dialog:
<KbdGroup>
     <Kbd>⊞</Kbd>
     <span>+</span>
     <Kbd>R</Kbd>
</KbdGroup>

Type `control`. Go to:
```
User Accounts → User Accounts
```
Change your account name back to the preferred name.

### Restore your profile picture
Go to:
```
Settings → Accounts → Your info
```
Set a new profile picture or upload your old one.

### Fix Your Account Password (Optional)
If you want to reset your password to something simple or blank:

Open Command Prompt as Administrator and run:
```cmd
net user <username> <password>
```
To set a blank password:
```cmd
net user <username> ""
```
Restart your PC afterward.

Finally, re-add your normal desktop shortcuts if needed.

## Step 8 - Repair Windows System Files (SFC & DISM)
NoEscape.exe corrupts several Windows components, including:
- System policies
- Login settings
- User profiles
- Explorer visuals
- Registry permissions
- Windows shell stability

To ensure your system is fully functional, run the built-in Windows repair tools.

### 1. System File Checker (SFC)

Open Command Prompt as Administrator and run:
```cmd
sfc /scannow
```
This will scan and repair:
- Modified Windows files
- Missing DLLs
- Corrupted components
- System shell inconsistencies

> [!NOTE]
> If SFC says that it found corrupt files and repaired them — this is normal after malware removal.

### 2. Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM)

If SFC shows errors it **cannot** fix, run DISM:
```cmd
DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
```
DISM repairs deeper Windows components such as:
- WinSxS store
- System image corruption
- Recovery files
- Windows update components

> [!IMPORTANT]
> DISM requires an active internet connection unless you’re using an offline image.

### 3. Run SFC Again

After DISM completes, run:
```cmd
sfc /scannow
```
This ensures all corrupt or modified files from NoEscape.exe are fully repaired.

### Optional (Strongly Recommended): Windows Update Refresh

Go to **Settings → Update & Security → Windows Update**

Run **Check for Updates**.

Windows will reapply critical system files and drivers to guarantee system integrity.

## Step 9 - Removing the Most Dangerous Variant: September 18
Signs:
- Opening any `exe` file leads to opening notepad and typing **THERE'S NO ESCAPE...**
- Typing either **Yes** or **No** leads to bootloader corruption
- Makes PC unbootable

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This variant cannot be removed using only registry fixes.

### Restoring the bootloader
1. Boot into Windows PE
2. Back up your files (just in case)
3. Place TestDisk Portable from a different USB: https://www.cgsecurity.org/Download_and_donate.php/testdisk-7.2-WIP.win.zip (Make sure to download TestDisk on a secondary healthy PC and place it on the another flash drive)
4. Copy the files into the Windows PE flash drive
5. Launch TestDisk, select `No Log`, then navigate to:
```
<Your Drive Name> → EFI GPT → Analyze → Quick search
```
6. Once choose partition with
- Your files
- Less capacity
Press the right arrow key and type **P**
7. Open the cmd and type:
```cmd
bootrec /fixmbr
bootrec /fixboot
bootrec /rebuildbcd
```
8. Press Enter on TestDisk, Select write, and type **Y**
9. Navigate to:
```
Advanced → MS Data → Boot → Repair MFT → OK → Rebuild BS
```
10. Open the CMD and type these commands to make sure the boot sector is rebuilt:
```cmd
bootrec /fixmbr
bootrec /fixboot
bootrec /rebuildbcd
```
11. Open Disk Manager, and refresh it.

If you see the C: Disk here, that means the boot sector is restored. If **Rebuild BS** command was failed, the only option is to reinstall Windows

## Conclusion
And that’s it! NoEscape.exe has been completely removed from your system.
This malware modifies registry entries, themes, user accounts, wallpapers, and core Windows settings, so restoring everything manually is critical.

To prevent future infections:
- Delete suspicious `.exe` files immediately
- Never run unknown programs
- Use a stronger antivirus
- Keep real-time protection enabled
