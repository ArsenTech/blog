## Introduction
Do you want to make your Linux terminal look modern, cool, professional, and beautiful?
This guide will show how to customize your Linux terminal using:
- [**Fish shell**](https://fishshell.com/)
- [**oh-my-posh**](https://ohmyposh.dev/)
- [**Nerd Fonts**](https://www.nerdfonts.com/)
- **neofetch**

It's perfect for both beginners and advanced Linux users! 🐧

## Step 1 - Installing the Fish Shell
Open the preferred terminal, then run:
<CMDBlock
     shell="bash"
     data={{
          Debian: "sudo apt-get install fish",
          "Debian (Alt Method)": "sudo apt install fish",
          Arch: "sudo pacman -S fish",
          Fedora: "sudo dnf install fish"
     }}
/>
Enter your password and press `Y` when prompted.

After that, type `fish` to verify the shell works.

## Step 2 - Installing Oh-my-posh
Oh-my-posh lets you customize your shell with beautiful prompt themes.

### Method 1
1. Go to the Official GitHub repo of oh-my-posh: https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh
2. Open the Releases section and download the correct executable:
     - `posh-linux-amd64` - for x64 systems
     - `posh-linux-arm` - for ARM
     - `posh-linux-arm64` - for ARM64

3. Download **themes.zip** as well.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're unsure about your CPU architecture, run `uname -m`, and then download the correct executable

#### Extracting themes
Once **themes.zip** has finished downloading, create the folder:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.poshthemes # or mkdir -p /home/<username>/.poshthemes
```
Then run the following command:
```bash
unzip ~/Downloads/themes.zip -d ~/.poshthemes
```
This extracts all `.omp.json` theme files.

> [!TIP]
Using the unzip command saves time compared to extracting through the file manager.

#### Installing the binary
After that, rename the executable to `oh-my-posh` and choose where to place it.

- Install to `~/.local/bin` (Recommended)
     ```bash
     cp ~/Downloads/oh-my-posh ~/.local/bin
     chmod +x ~/.local/bin/oh-my-posh
     ```
- Install to `/usr/bin` (system-wide)
     ```bash
     sudo cp ~/Downloads/oh-my-posh /usr/bin
     sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/oh-my-posh
     ```
Make sure to type `oh-my-posh` and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> to verify the installation.

### Method 2
To install oh-my-posh quickly, run the following command:
```bash
curl -s https://ohmyposh.dev/install.sh | bash -s
```
And themes will be installed in the `~/.cache/oh-my-posh/themes` folder.

## Step 3 - Changing the Terminal Font
Go to the official Nerd Fonts download page:
https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads

Choose a font such as Fira Code Nerd Font, and download the chosen font.

Extract these fonts into the folder and update the font references by running the following command:
``` bash
unzip ~/Downloads/<font-name>.zip -d ~/.local/share/fonts
sudo fc-cache -f -v
```

### Changing font settings
- **KDE Plasma** → System Settings → Appearance → Fonts → *Fixed Width*
- **Linux Mint** → System Settings → Fonts → *Monospace*
Choose your installed nerd font.

## Step 4 - Profile Configuration
Open the `~/.config/fish/config.fish` file with the text editor, and add this above the if statement:
```fish
oh-my-posh init fish -c ~/.poshthemes/<theme>.omp.json | source
```
If you installed via the [second method](#method-2):
```fish
oh-my-posh init fish -c ~/.cache/oh-my-posh/themes/<theme>.omp.json | source
```
> `<theme>` - Any [oh-my-posh theme](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/themes) (example: atomic)

### KDE Plasma
1. Open Terminal settings → Manage Profiles
2. Create a new profile
3. Set the command to `/bin/fish` (or `/usr/bin/fish`)
4. Check Default Profile → Apply → OK

### Linux Mint
1. Right-click on Terminal → Preferences
2. Create a profile
3. Go to the Command section
4. Enable the "Run a custom command instead of my shell" option
5. Enter `fish` as a custom command.
6. Open the dropdown menu and select "Set as default".

## Step 5 - Changing the color scheme
Color schemes improve your terminal appearance.

### KDE Plasma:
1. Terminal → Manage Profiles
2. Select your profile → Edit
3. Appearance → Choose a color scheme
4. Or click "Get New", search e.g., Dracula, install the color scheme, and choose it
Apply → OK

### Linux Mint:
Right-click on the terminal → Preferences → Colors → Select a scheme

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure to edit the correct profile.

(Recommended: the GNOME color scheme.)
Once finished, click on the Close button

## Adding neofetch
Run the following command to install neofetch:
<CMDBlock
     shell="bash"
     data={{
          Debian: "sudo apt-get install neofetch",
          "Debian (Alt Method)": "sudo apt install neofetch",
          Arch: "sudo pacman -S neofetch",
          Fedora: "sudo dnf install neofetch"
     }}
/>

Then open the preferred file explorer, open the `~/.config/fish/config.fish` file with the text editor, and add `neofetch` above the oh-my-posh command.

## Root Terminal Customization
While the user terminal customization is complete, we're customizing the root terminal now. Run the following command to enter the root terminal:
```bash
sudo su
# Requires entering the password if prompted
```
Extract `themes.zip` again into the newly created folder:
```bash
unzip /home/<username>/Downloads/themes.zip -d ~/.poshthemes
```
Edit the `config.fish` with nano:
```bash
nano ~/.config/config.fish
```
Add the oh-my-posh command above the if statement:
```fish
oh-my-posh init fish -c ~/.poshthemes/<theme>.omp.json | source
```
If you installed via the [second method](#method-2):
```fish
oh-my-posh init fish -c /home/<username>/.cache/oh-my-posh/themes/<theme>.omp.json | source
```
After that, save the file by pressing
<KbdGroup>
     <Kbd>Ctrl</Kbd>
     <span>+</span>
     <Kbd>S</Kbd>
</KbdGroup>
And close Nano by pressing
<KbdGroup>
     <Kbd>Ctrl</Kbd>
     <span>+</span>
     <Kbd>X</Kbd>
</KbdGroup>
Change root shell:
```bash
chsh -s /bin/fish
```
And restart the root terminal:
```bash
exit
sudo su
```
The root terminal is successfully customized!

## Bash Shell Customization
If you're still using the Bash terminal and you don't want to change the shell to fish, this section will help you apply Oh My Posh to the Bash shell.

Open the terminal, and run the following command:
```bash
sudo nano ~/.bashrc
```
This opens the `.bashrc` file with nano. Then scroll all the way down and add the following bash command:
```bash
neofetch # If you want to add neofetch
eval "$(oh-my-posh init bash -c ~/.poshthemes/<theme>.omp.json)"
```
If you installed via the [second method](#method-2):
```bash
neofetch # If you want to add neofetch
eval "$(oh-my-posh init bash -c ~/.cache/oh-my-posh/themes/<theme>.omp.json)"
```
Save the file by pressing
<KbdGroup>
     <Kbd>Ctrl</Kbd>
     <span>+</span>
     <Kbd>S</Kbd>
</KbdGroup>
And close Nano by pressing
<KbdGroup>
     <Kbd>Ctrl</Kbd>
     <span>+</span>
     <Kbd>X</Kbd>
</KbdGroup>
Use the following command to apply the changes:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```
> [!NOTE]
> Use
> `eval "$(oh-my-posh init bash -c /home/<username>/.cache/oh-my-posh/themes/<theme>.omp.json)"`
> If you used the [second method](#method-2) and you want to change the bash shell of the root terminal (`.bashrc` inside the root terminal)

## Conclusion
And that's it! Your Linux terminal is now fully modern, clean, and stylish.
From installing fish to using oh-my-posh and Nerd Fonts, you now have a powerful terminal setup that looks way better than the default design.

Whether you're a developer, a student, or someone exploring Linux for the first time, having a clean and beautiful terminal can make your daily tasks more enjoyable.
You can always experiment with different color schemes, fonts, and themes until you find the perfect style for your system.
