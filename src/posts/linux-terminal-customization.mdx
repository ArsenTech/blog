## Introduction
Do you want to make your Linux terminal to look modern, cool, professional, and beautiful? This guide will help you make your Linux terminal look modern using the fish shell, oh-my-posh, neofetch, and Nerd Fonts. It's ideal for Linux users and those new to the Linux operating system! 🐧

- [Linux Mint Terminal Tutorial](https://youtu.be/joCLQhCqP4E) (If you use Linux Mint)

## Step 1 - Installing the Fish Shell
Open the preferred terminal, then type the following command:
<CMDBlock
     shell="bash"
     data={{
          Debian: "sudo apt-get install fish",
          "Debian (Alt Method)": "sudo apt install fish",
          Arch: "sudo pacman -S fish",
          Fedora: "sudo dnf install fish"
     }}
/>
Type the password and hit `Y` to install the fish shell.

After that, type `fish` to make sure the fish terminal is working.

## Step 2 - Installing Oh-my-posh
Oh-my-posh allows you to have customized Linux shell with your preferred theme.

### Method 1
Go to the [Github Repo](https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh) of oh-my-posh, then **Releases**. Then download one of these executables:
- `posh-linux-amd64` - Choose this option if your Linux distro was installed on the x64 architecture,
- `posh-linux-arm` - For `arm` architecture users,
- `posh-linux-arm64` - for the `arm64` architecture users.

Then Download themes by clicking on `themes.zip`.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're unsure which architecture you use, use the `uname -m` command to check the architecture, and download the correct executable.

If the download of `themes.zip` is finished, create a folder in `/home/<username>` (or `~` alias) called ".poshthemes". Copy `themes.zip` from Downloads, and paste it into `~/.poshthemes`.

Right click on the zip file, and select **Extract here** (or **Extract** > **Extract archive here** if you use KDE plasme). After that, move every single `.json` file to `.poshthemes` and delete the extracted folder.

> [!TIP]
> To save more time, use
> `unzip ~/Downloads/themes.zip -d ~/.poshthemes`
> which does the same action without wasting some time.

After that, rename the executable to `oh-my-posh` and copy the executable using the following commands:

#### Pasting in `~/.local/bin`
If you want to copy it to `~/.local/bin`, use
```bash
cp ~/Downloads/oh-my-posh ~/.local/bin
```
then run
```bash
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/oh-my-posh
```
#### Pasting in `/usr/bin`
If you want to copy it to the `/usr/bin` folder, use
```bash
sudo cp ~/Downloads/oh-my-posh /usr/bin
```
then run
```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/oh-my-posh
```
The oh-my-posh is installed successfully. Make sure to type `oh-my-posh` and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> to verify the installation.

### Method 2
If you want to save some time, run the following command:
```bash
curl -s https://ohmyposh.dev/install.sh | bash -s
```
to install `oh-my-posh` without consuming some time, but themes will be installed in the `~/.cache/oh-my-posh/themes` folder.

## Step 3 - Changing the Terminal Font
Go to the [Nerd Fonts Download Page](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) and choose the preferred Nerd font (e.g. **Fira Code Nerd Font**) to download.

Use the following command to extract these fonts into the folder and update the font references:
``` bash
# <font-name> = FiraCode for example (Downloaded font name)
unzip ~/Downloads/<font-name>.zip -d ~/.local/share/fonts
sudo fc-cache -f -v
```

### Changing font settings
- **KDE**: Open System settings, then Appearance -> Fonts. Change the "Fixed Width" to the Downloaded Nerd font (In this case: Fira Code Nerd Font)
- **Linux Mint**: Open System settings, then Font Selection. Change Monospace into the Downloaded Nerd font (In this case: Fira Code Nerd Font)

## Step 4 - Profile Configuration
Open the preferred file explorer, then go to `~/.config/fish`. Open the `config.fish` with the text editor, and add the following (above the if statement):
```fish
oh-my-posh init fish -c ~/.poshthemes/<theme>.omp.json | source
```
Or if you used the [second method](#method-2), use the following:
```fish
oh-my-posh init fish -c ~/.cache/oh-my-posh/themes/<theme>.omp.json | source
```

### KDE Plasma
Go to the Terminal settings and then "Create New Profile".

Add the preferred name for the profile, then set the command to `/bin/fish` (or `/usr/bin/fish`).

Finally, check the "Default Profile" option, then click on **Apply** and **OK**

### Linux Mint
Right click on the terminal, and select "Preferences".

Click on the `+` Button and Add the preferred name for the profile.

Go to the "Commands" Section, check the "Run a custom command instead of my shell" option, and type `fish` as a custom command.

After that, open the dropdown menu, and select "Set as default".
And With that, We've configured the oh-my-posh shell!

## Step 5 - Changing the color scheme
Color scheme in this customization is important. Here's how to change the color scheme.

### KDE Plasma:
Go to the Terminal settings and then **Manage Profiles**. Select the correct profile, then click on "Edit".

Now go to the Appearance Section, then choose the preferred color scheme. If you can't find one, click on "Get New", Search the preferred color scheme (e.g. `Dracula`). Click on the Color scheme item to install the color scheme, and choose the installed one.

After that, click on "Apply", then "OK".

### Linux Mint:
Right click on the terminal, and select "Preferences"

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure to edit the correct profile.

Go to the "Colors" Section, then choose the preferred color scheme. I'd recommend you using the GNOME color scheme.

Once finished, click on the Close button

## Adding neofetch
Use the following command to install neofetch
<CMDBlock
     shell="bash"
     data={{
          Debian: "sudo apt-get install neofetch",
          "Debian (Alt Method)": "sudo apt install neofetch",
          Arch: "sudo pacman -S neofetch",
          Fedora: "sudo dnf install neofetch"
     }}
/>

Then Open the preferred file explorer, then go to `~/.config/fish`. Open the `config.fish` with the text editor, and add `neofetch` above the oh-my-posh command to set the neofetch.

## Root Terminal Customization
While the user terminal customization is complete, we're customizing the root terminal now. Use the following command to enter the root terminal:
```bash
sudo su # Enters the root terminal, but requires password to enter
``
Then type the password.

First, extract `themes.zip` into the newly created folder:
```bash
unzip /home/<username>/Downloads/themes.zip -d ~/.poshthemes
```
Then open the `config.fish` with nano:
```bash
nano ~/.config/config.fish
```
Now add the oh-my-posh command above the if statement:
```fish
oh-my-posh init fish -c ~/.poshthemes/<theme>.omp.json | source
```
Or if you used the [second method](#method-2), use the following:
```fish
oh-my-posh init fish -c /home/<username>/.cache/oh-my-posh/themes/<theme>.omp.json | source
```
