### Requirements
- Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (bootloop / no OS)
- Charging cable
- Correct firmware (GT-P3100 or GT-P5100)
- Samsung Odin (Firmware flashing tool)

> [!WARNING]
> Follow each step carefully. Flashing firmware incorrectly may cause further damage or a soft brick.

## Step 1 - Downloading Tools
Download the correct firmware for your device:
- **GT-P3100**: https://samsony.net/en/firmwares/samsung/GT-P3100
- **GT-P5100**https://samsony.net/en/firmwares/samsung/GT-P5100

Download the latest version of Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean for your model. Then download the latest Samsung Odin tool here: https://samsungodin.com/

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These files are large. Downloading may take time, so be patient :-)

## Step 2 - Extracting Tools and Flashing the Firmware
After downloading:
- Extract the firmware ZIP
- Extract Odin
Open Odin on your PC.

### Enter Download Mode
On Samsung Galaxy Tab 2:
- Hold the **Power + Volume Down** at the same time
- When prompted, press the **Volume up** button.
This enters the Download Mode (Odin Mode), which means the device is ready to flash the firmware.

Now connect the device to your PC using the charging cable.

### Load Firmware in Odin
On odin:
1. Click on AP
2. Select the firmware file: `*.tar.md5`

> [!NOTE]
> the `.tar.md5` file is the correct firmware package for Samsung devices.

Click on the **START** button and wait until Odin displays **PASS**.

> [!TIP]
> After flashing, you'll see the classic Samsung Android updating screen. Let it finish completely.

When the Samsung logo appears, the firmware flash was successful.

## Step 3 - Perform a Factory Reset
To prevent boot issues after flashing:
1. Hold Power + Volume Up
2. Navigate to `Wipe data/factory reset`
3. Select **Yes**
4. Finally, choose `Reboot system now`

## Step 4 - Initial Setup
After reboot, complete the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 setup:
1. Choose your Language (e.g. `English (United States)`)
2. Tap Start
3. Connect to Wi-Fi or skip
4. Enable **Automatic date and time**
5. Skip Samsung Account
6. Skip Google Account for now
7. Enter a name (optional)
8. Skip Dropbox setup
9. Tap Finish

Your Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 is now restored to working condition.

## Conclusion
And that's it! Your Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 has now been fully repaired and restored to official stock Android.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Always back up your data before attempting custom ROM installations or firmware flashes.

If you want to upgrade the Tab 2 (or another old Samsung device) to LineageOS in the future, follow every step carefully to avoid losing the Android system again.
